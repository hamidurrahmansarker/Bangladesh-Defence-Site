# Bangladesh-Defense-Site
In December 2019, during my 3rd-semester course, "Introduction to Internet Lab" (CSE 303) at the World University of Bangladesh, I developed the "Bangladesh Defense Site" as part of an assignment.

Recognizing the common challenge faced by individuals seeking news updates and applying to various defense sites in Bangladesh, I aimed to simplify the process. The country has multiple defense sites, making it cumbersome for many to navigate through different websites.

Hence, my project provides a convenient solution, allowing users to access all defense websites simultaneously, streamlining the information-gathering process for those interested in serving their country
